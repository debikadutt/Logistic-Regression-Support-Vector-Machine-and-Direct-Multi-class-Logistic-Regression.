# Logistic-Regression-Support-Vector-Machine-and-Direct-Multi-class-Logistic-Regression.
- Classified the handwritten digits into one of the ten possible digits using Binary Logistic regression and Support Vector Machine tool using a linear kernel and radial basis function with gamma set to 1 and 0 and compared the performance of each of these methods. - Gradient descent is used to minimize the error. - Implemented logistic regression to solve the multi-class classification problem by calculating posterior probability with the help of a softmax transformation function.
